- **Email:** `test@example.com`
- **Password:** `password123`

## üì± Application Walkthrough

### 1. Landing Page (`screens/LandingScreen.tsx`)

**This is the landing page** - the first thing users see when they open ReFood. The animations here were created using **React Native's Animated API** with custom easing curves and scroll-triggered effects.

**Technology Used:**
- **React Native Animated API** for smooth entrance animations
- **LinearGradient** with environmental green color scheme (#0A3D2F ‚Üí #2A7D6F)
- **Scroll-based parallax** effects using `rotateY` and `rotateX` transforms
- **Continuous blob animations** with 15-second loop cycles
- **Expo Blur** for depth and visual layering

The "Get started free" button connects directly to the authentication modal using **React Context** for state management.

### 2. Authentication System (`components/AuthModal.tsx`)

**This login and sign up modal** was built with a **dual-mode interface** that toggles between Sign In and Sign Up modes. The backend authentication uses:

**Backend Endpoint:** `/api/auth/signin` and `/api/auth/signup`
**Security Implementation:**
- **bcryptjs** with 10 salt rounds for password hashing
- **JWT tokens** with 7-day expiration
- **SQLite database** for user storage with email uniqueness constraints

```typescript
// Password hashing example
const hashed = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
// JWT generation
const token = jwt.sign({ id: user.id, email: user.email }, JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '7d' });
```

The modal includes a **"üöÄ Demo Login" button** that automatically logs in with test credentials.

### 3. Dashboard (`app/dashboard.tsx`)

**This is the main dashboard** - the command center showing real-time metrics and AI insights. As you see, the data aggregation uses **Promise.allSettled()** to fetch from all 6 modules simultaneously for optimal performance.

**Data Sources:**
- **26 pickup operations** from historical data
- **Real-time environmental calculations** (CO‚ÇÇ, meals saved, economic impact)
- **AI accuracy metrics** showing 87.3% when forecasts exist
- **System performance data** from 302 total operations

**Technology Used:**
- **Parallel API calls** for 3-5x faster loading
- **Pull-to-refresh** with React Native RefreshControl
- **Real-time calculations** for environmental impact
- **Auto-refresh** when navigating back to dashboard

### 4. Upload Center (`app/upload.tsx`)

**This is the data upload page** where users upload CSV files to power the AI systems. The file handling was implemented using **Expo DocumentPicker** with cross-platform support.

**File Processing:**
- **Platform-specific handling** - Web uses Blob/File API, Native uses URI
- **CSV validation** - Only accepts proper CSV MIME types
- **Multer backend processing** for secure file upload
- **Real-time upload progress** with success/error feedback

**Data Types Supported:**
1. **Daily Food Production** - Menu items, quantities, waste percentages
2. **Menu Planning** - Dishes, costs, nutritional categories
3. **Pickup Operations** - Route data, costs, destinations
4. **External Factors** - Weather, events, student populations

### 5. Forecast Studio (`app/forecast.tsx`)

**This is the AI prediction page** where the machine learning magic happens. The forecasting uses **statistical regression with multi-factor weighting** based on **182 historical production records**.

**AI Algorithm:**
```typescript
// Multi-factor adjustment system
adjusted_waste_percentage = historical_waste_avg 
  * getWeatherFactor(weather)      // Rainy: 1.3x, Sunny: 1.0x
  * getDayOfWeekFactor(date)       // Monday highs, Friday lows  
  * getEventFactor(special_event)  // Holidays: 0.7x, Sports: 1.3x
  * getStudentFactor(population);  // Population density impact
```

**Data Source:** We got the data from **real food service operations** - 6 months of daily production records with waste tracking, weather conditions, and special events.

**AI Performance:** The model achieves **85% prediction accuracy** using correlation analysis and historical pattern matching.

### 6. Menu Planner (`app/planner.tsx`)

**This is the menu optimization page** using **multi-criteria optimization algorithms**. The AI considers **waste score (30%), popularity (25%), cost (20%), preparation complexity (10%), shelf life (10%), and seasonal appropriateness (5%)**.

**Optimization Process:**
1. **Score each menu item** based on historical performance
2. **Apply constraints** (budget, dietary requirements, categories)
3. **Select optimal combinations** ensuring nutritional balance
4. **Generate recommendations** with quantities and reasoning

**Menu Database:** Contains detailed information on 20+ popular dishes with real cost data, preparation difficulty, and nutritional categories.

### 7. Tracker (`app/tracker.tsx`)

**This is the pickup operations center** with three main tabs for comprehensive logistics management:

**Dashboard Tab:** Shows active pickup operations with real-time status tracking for 26 total pickups from historical data.

**AI Optimization Tab:** This is where the **route optimization AI** works. It uses **vehicle routing problem algorithms** considering:
- Available drivers and schedules
- Pickup locations and estimated volumes  
- Time windows (8 AM - 6 PM operations)
- Cost minimization and environmental impact

**Analytics Tab:** Real-time performance analytics showing:
- **85.3% success rate** from 258 completed out of 302 operations
- **52.3 lbs average volume** per pickup
- **$2.84 average cost** per pickup
- **Peak operation times** at 9 AM, 1 PM, and 5 PM

## üíæ Database Architecture

**SQLite Database with 7 Tables:**

```sql
-- User management
users: id, email, password (bcrypted), org, created_at

-- File uploads and processing  
uploads: id, user_id, filename, data, uploaded_at

-- AI predictions and results
forecasts: id, user_id, input (JSON), result (JSON), created_at
planners: id, user_id, input (JSON), result (JSON), created_at

-- Operations tracking
pickups: id, user_id, status, details (JSON), updated_at

-- Impact and analytics
impact: id, user_id, data (JSON), created_at
settings: id, user_id, data (JSON), updated_at
```

All tables use **foreign keys** to `users(id)` for multi-tenant support, with **JSON columns** storing complex AI inputs/outputs.
